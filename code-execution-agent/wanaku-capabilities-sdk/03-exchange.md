Create protobuf message specifications for a code-execution engine within the Wanaku framework that enables communication between microservices. The specifications must align with the existing standards and conventions established in the capabilities-exchange module. Define messages for client-to-server communication that include a text blob field containing executable code and an optional map field with string key-value pairs representing code execution arguments. Define the server response as a streaming message that transmits code execution results to the client, with the gRPC channel closing automatically upon execution completion. Ensure all message definitions follow the naming conventions, field numbering schemes, documentation patterns, and structural organization present in the capabilities-exchange module's existing protobuf specifications.
