You are implementing a code-execution engine for Wanaku. Your task is to design and create the data types required for this project.

First, thoroughly analyze the file wanaku/02-rest-endpoints.md to understand the REST API specifications, request/response structures, and data flow requirements. Based on this analysis, identify all necessary data types including but not limited to request payloads, response objects, execution contexts, code submission structures, result formats, error types, status enumerations, and any supporting types needed for the API endpoints.

Then implement these data types with appropriate fields, type annotations, validation constraints, and documentation. Ensure the types are comprehensive, type-safe, and align precisely with the REST endpoint specifications. Include types for authentication tokens, execution parameters, resource limits, timeout configurations, language specifications, code input/output formats, execution results, error responses, and any metadata structures required by the endpoints.

Create only the data type definitions without implementing any business logic, handlers, or execution functionality.
