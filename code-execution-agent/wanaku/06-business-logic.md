Implement the complete business logic for the code execution request flow in the code-execution-agent system. When a POST request arrives at /api/v2/code-execution-engine/${engine-type}/${language}, the system must query the capabilities repository database to locate an appropriate code-execution-engine service by matching serviceType as "code-execution-engine", serviceSubType matching the provided engine-type parameter, and serviceName matching the provided language parameter. After identifying the target service, establish the communication bridge by: first, integrating the new command generated from wanuku-capabilities-sdk/03-exchange.md into the gRPC transport layer; second, creating a new CodeExecution bridge component to handle service communication; and third, invoking the bridge methods from the business layer to complete the request handling pipeline. Review all files within the code-execution-agent directory to understand the full context across different projects before implementation.
