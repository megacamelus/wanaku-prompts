Based on the database type changes documented in wanaku-capabilities-sdk/03-service-types.md, refactor the codebase to align with the updated ServiceTarget data structure. Ensure all references to ServiceTarget throughout the code are modified to reflect the new type definitions, including any changes to field names, data types, nested structures, and relationships. Update method signatures, constructors, serialization logic, validation rules, and any dependent components that interact with ServiceTarget.

Subsequently, modify the InfinispanCapabilitiesRepository implementation to accommodate the new fields in the ServiceTarget structure. Specifically, update the Infinispan column definitions, indexing strategies, and data mapping configurations to properly store and retrieve the newly added fields. Adjust the repository's query methods, cache configuration, and any custom serialization or deserialization logic to handle the expanded ServiceTarget schema. Ensure that the Infinispan schema evolution is handled correctly, including migration considerations for existing data if applicable, and verify that all CRUD operations function correctly with the updated column structure.

Lastly, introduce a new repository named InfinispanCodeTaskRepository used to store the data from the CodeExecutionTask instances.
